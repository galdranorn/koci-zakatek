duty-header: Duty of care
duty-subheader-1: Animal Protection Act
duty-act-1: >-
  The document that regulates the legal rights of animals in Poland, including cats, is 
  <span class="orange">the Act of August 21, 1997 on the protection of animals</span>.
  The Act guarantees free-roaming cats the possibility of living in the places where 
  they were born and reside. This means <strong>providing them with areas where they 
  can protect themselves</strong> from the cold and danger, as well as the possibility 
  of being fed.
duty-act-2: >-
  The Protection of Animals Act is a <span class="orange">document that supersedes</span> the regulations, 
  statutes, resolutions of various bodies in the city of Wroclaw, such as the management of garden 
  allotments, the administrators of a multi-family buildings. <strong>It is against the law</strong> 
  to forbid feeding of free-roaming cats, completely preventing them from access to cellars, demanding 
  that cats be removed from the premises or placed in shelters!

duty-subheader-2: Communal Care Program
duty-program-1: >-
  Gmina Wrocław realizuje ustawowy obowiązek ustanowienia lokalnych regulacji 
  w kwestii zwierząt bezdomnych i wolno żyjących. Każdego roku Urząd Miasta przygotowuje 
  <span class="blue">Program opieki nad zwierzętami bezdomnymi oraz zapobiegania bezdomności zwierząt 
  na terenie Gminy Wrocław</span>.

  The Province of Wrocław implements the statutory obligations to establish local regulations 
  regarding homeless and free-roaming animals. Each year, the City Hall prepares 
  <span class="blue">the Homeless Animal Care Program and addresses homelessness of animals 
  in the Wrocław Province</span>. 
duty-program-2: >-
  The Program proposal is published on the website of the City Hall and is the subject of the so-called 
  public consultation - this means that <strong>every private person or organization has the right 
  to submit their comments</strong> or recommendation for consideration within the prescribed period. 
  The final version of the Program comes into force pursuant to the Resolution of the Wrocław 
  City Council.

duty-subheader-3: Free-roaming cats
duty-free-1: >-
  Majority of the cats outside are <strong>free-roaming cats</strong>, i.e. those born outdoors 
  and usually residing within their territory.<br><br>
  But remember that some of them are also former domestic cats that ended up outdoors for various 
  reasons and most of them <strong>will not survive without human intervention</strong>.
duty-free-2: >-
  If you find an injured or sick animal, defenseless kittens or an evidently domesticated cat,
  <span class="orange">don't leave it unattended!</span>

duty-subheader-4: Accident victims
duty-accident-1: >-
  Animals in the city are often victims of <strong>traffic accidents, disease, hunger or aggression 
  on the part of humans</strong>. If you find a carcass of a cat or any other animal, please report 
  it to the appropriate services.
duty-accident-contact: Collection of animal remains from public places and&nbsp;common&nbsp;areas
duty-accident-number: Municipal Police 986 (around the clock)
duty-accident-2: >-
  Finding a carcass of an animal in an area under the management of an institution or company should
  be reported <strong>to the manager or owner</strong> of the area or property.
duty-accident-3: >-
  Warning! If you find a cat corpse from a known herd - you feed, sterilize, etc. - and you have 
  reason to suspect that the cat has been the victim of a person’s act (ie. occupant of the estate, 
  neighbor, allotment farmer etc.), for example, as a result of poisoning, secure the corpse and 
  contact the shelter. The shelter <strong>is able to perform an autopsy</strong> to confirm or deny 
  your suspicions of the cause of death.
  <span class="blue">Only in this way can we fight cruelty against cats, and legally pursue 
  the perpetrators!</span>

shelter-header: A shelter for homeless animals
shelter-text-1: >-
  There is a shelter for homeless animals in Wrocław. It is run by the Animal Care Society under
  an agreement with the Wrocław Community. The shelter can accommodate approximately 200 cats
  simultaneously.
shelter-text-2: But remember that the shelter is&nbsp;the&nbsp;last&nbsp;resort!
shelter-text-3: >-
  Many animals become depressed which, sometimes results in death, and are exposed to 
  the risk of fatal viral diseases. <strong>Do whatever you can</strong> to ensure the animal
  in need is placed in a home-like environment!
shelter-text-4: >-
  If you are trying to catch a cat on your own and you are unsuccessful, you can turn to the 
  shelter for help! It is mentioned in <strong>the Municipal Animal Care Program</strong>.
  If possible, the shelter may also facilitate sterilization and keep the cat after the procedure.

commune-title: Local Municipality Offer of Help
commune-subtitle-1: Sterilization cards
commune-cards-budget: >-
  Every year, Wrocław shelter for homeless animals allocates budget to finance <span class="orange">Sterilization
  Cards for free-roaming cats</span>, commonly known as coupons. The animals can undergo treatment in several
  clinics selected by tender (their addresses can be found on the card). Every year, <strong>over 2,000 such 
  cards</strong> are issued to the inhabitants of the District.
commune-cards-shelter: >-
  The card can be obtained by <span class="orange">any resident of the Wrocław Region</span> who plans to sterilize
  a cat living in the Wrocław area. One person may receive a <strong>maximum of 2 cards at a time (once a month)</strong>.
  Cards are issued at the shelter at the beginning of each month. The exact dates are published on the shelter's website.
commune-cards-shelter-cta: Visit the shelter's website
commune-cards-shelter-link: https://www.schroniskowroclaw.pl/)
commune-cards-list-intro: To receive the card you must
commune-cards-list-1: have an <strong>ID card</strong>,
commune-cards-list-2: provide your <strong>personal details</strong>,
commune-cards-list-3: >- 
   identify the location (street, name of the area, facility)<strong>where the cat</strong>you intend to sterilize
   <strong>resides</strong>.
commune-cards-outro: >- 
  At this point the District’s participation in the reduction of the city’s cat population ends. <span class="orange">You 
  become responsible</span>for the trapping, transporting and - most importantly – providing care during the cat’s convalescing period.
commune-cards-help: >-
  Occasional help in catching or keeping a cat after surgery can be provided by <strong>shelter or animal
  organizations</strong>.
commune-cards-img: /assets/wroclove/commune-1.jpg

commune-subtitle-2: Cat food
commune-food-text: >-
  Every month, the shelter in Wrocław also provides dry food to animal welfare carers, the purchase of which
  is financed by the Wrocław Regional District under an agreement with the shelter. <span class="blue">You should
  contact the shelter to become eligible</span> and learn if and when it will be feasible. You will then be
  <strong>entered on the list of feeders in Wrocław</strong>. The amount of food allocated to you depends 
  on the number of cats under your care.

card-title: Social welfare card
card-text: >-
  If you regularly look after a group of free-roaming cats in your district, you are eligible to obtain
  a social welfare card from the City Hall. Considering the various difficulties often associated with feeding
  cats in Wrocław, <span class="orange">we urge you to do so</span>! Official authorization of your involvement
  in caring for homeless animals <strong>reinforces the legitimate nature of your actions, especially to "vocal neighborhood critics" or property managers</strong> with an unfavorable attitude to cats.
card-how-1: How to obtain such a document? It's very simple. Just send an e-mail to
card-mail: malgorzata.szewczyk@um.wroc.pl
card-how-list-intro: stating
card-how-list-1: your <strong>full name</strong>,
card-how-list-2: <strong>ID card</strong> number,
card-how-list-3: the <strong>address</strong>, where "your" cats are located.
card-how-outro: Documents are also issued during the covid-19 pandemic. You will receive it by e-mail.

foundations-title: Local pro-animal NGOs
foundations-text-1: >-
  There are <span class="blue">over a dozen</span> non-governmental organisations and informal groups
  in our city, whose aim is to <strong>help animals, including cats</strong>. We also help cats, their
  guardians or any community residents who find a cat in need. Remember that we operate in very challenging
  conditions and our ability to help is limited.
foundations-text-2: >-
  Every day we find new cats to be placed SOMEWHERE. Every day we receive applications, requests to accept
  or rescue more cats. We constantly look after several cat groups in the city, which also include sick
  or new cats that require protection and care. <strong>We are not able to accept them all</strong>...
foundations-alert: ...but you can also help!
foundations-text-3: >-
  If you come across a cat that needs to be taken "off the street" remember that <span class="blue">you can also
  take it home</span>! The housing conditions of the foundation's volunteers are not only not better than yours,
  but often much worse! <strong>Most of us have about 5-10 cats at a time</strong>!
foundation-text-4: >-
  If you lack experience in caring for rescued cats or it requires expensive treatment (surgery, etc.),
  you can, as a private person, <span class="blue">set up a fundraiser on one of the dedicated portals</span>,
  for example, <strong>pomagam.pl</strong> and share it among friends on your own Facebook profile, etc. To find
  the rescued cat a home, just take its pictures, describe its health, habits and character and post ads on various 
  advertising portals.
foundations-text-5: >-
  Warning! Remember, however, that once the cat is rescued, <span class="blue">its welfare should be guaranteed</span>,
  and as such it is your responsibility - so <strong>conduct a telephone interview</strong>with the potential cat
  guardian(s) and <strong>ask about fencing of the selected window or balcony areas</strong>.
foundations-text-6: >- 
  If you are able to provide a temporary home for a cat in need, but feel that its treatment or process
  of re-homing is too overwhelming, <span class="blue">you can turn to the foundation</span> for help.
foundations-image: /assets/wroclove/foundations-1.jpg

foundations-subtitle: Aid costs
foundations-costs-text-1: >-
  Every zloty counts! The cost of treatment, veterinary examinations and upkeep of 70-100&nbsp;cats a month
  in Koci Zakatek is enormous. In 2019, we spent <span class="orange">over&nbsp;PLN&nbsp;68,000</span> on cat
  treatment and <span class="orange">almost&nbsp;PLN&nbsp;64,000</span> on food.
foundations-costs-text-2: >-
  Despite the large number of animal-friendly organizations and such an overwhelming expenditure required
  to support the welfare of free-roaming animals, the Wrocław Regional District allocates
  <span class="orange">just&nbsp;PLN&nbsp;30,000 per year</span> to support the needs of <strong>all
  potential beneficiaries</strong>, which are distributed very fast at the beginning of the year. 
foundations-costs-text-3: >- 
  Unfortunatelly <strong>Wroclaw funds in annual budget do not include allowance to conduct some open competitions
  for NGO</strong>, which could have provided them wit more money for their vast needs.
foundations-costs-text-4: >-
  Our activities are possible mainly <span class="orange">thanks to wonderful selfless people</span> who allocate
  annually 1% tax deduction to our Foundation and make donations throughout the year to cover our expenses ensuring
  our ongoing commitment to this honorable cause.
foundations-costs-thanks: With all our hearts, on behalf of the cats - <span class="orange">thank you</span> :)
